🚀 SPPU ACM Student Chapter (SASC)
Bridging Innovation, Research, and Professional Excellence

Welcome to the official repository of the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) ACM Student Chapter. We are a community of thinkers, builders, and researchers dedicated to pushing the boundaries of the MCA curriculum and shaping the tech leaders of tomorrow.
🎯 Our Pillars of Excellence
I. The "Beyond-the-Books" Culture

Bridge to Industry Our primary mission is to close the gap between academic theory and the pulse of the tech industry. We move beyond the standard syllabus to bring hands-on expertise in:

    Agentic AI & LLMs

    Web3 & Decentralized Systems

    Advanced Cloud Architectures

    DevOps & Modern Infrastructure

II. Research & Publication Excellence

From Ideas to Impact Leveraging the vast resources of the ACM Digital Library, we foster a rigorous research environment. We don't just consume technology; we document its evolution. Our goal is to mentor students to:

    Conduct deep-dive technical research.

    Draft and refine scholarly papers.

    Present findings at prestigious international conferences.

III. Collaborative Innovation

Peer-to-Peer Learning We believe the best classroom is a shared screen. SASC is a hub for collective growth through:

    Code-Sprints: Intensive, focused building sessions.

    Hackathons: Solving real-world problems under pressure.

    Build-in-Public: Documenting our journey, learning from bugs, and celebrating successful deployments.

IV. Professional Ethics & Leadership

Coding with Conscience Technological skill without ethics is incomplete. Following the ACM global standard, we groom "Human-Centric Tech Leaders." We focus on:

    Understanding the societal impact of algorithms.

    Developing leadership and communication soft skills.

    Adhering to the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.
