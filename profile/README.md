🚀 SPPU ACM Student Chapter (SASC)
__Bridging Innovation, Research, and Professional Excellence__

Welcome to the official repository of the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) ACM Student Chapter. We are a community of thinkers, builders, and researchers dedicated to pushing the boundaries of the MCA curriculum and shaping the tech leaders of tomorrow.

🎯 Our Pillars of Excellence

I. *The "Beyond-the-Books" Culture*

Bridge to Industry Our primary mission is to close the gap between academic theory and the pulse of the tech industry. We move beyond the standard syllabus to bring hands-on expertise in:

    Agentic AI & LLMs

    Web3 & Decentralized Systems

    Advanced Cloud Architectures

    DevOps & Modern Infrastructure

II. *Research & Publication Excellence*

From Ideas to Impact Leveraging the vast resources of the ACM Digital Library, we foster a rigorous research environment. We don't just consume technology; we document its evolution. Our goal is to mentor students to:

    Conduct deep-dive technical research.

    Draft and refine scholarly papers.

    Present findings at prestigious international conferences.

III. *Collaborative Innovation*

Peer-to-Peer Learning We believe the best classroom is a shared screen. SASC is a hub for collective growth through:

    Code-Sprints: Intensive, focused building sessions.

    Hackathons: Solving real-world problems under pressure.

    Build-in-Public: Documenting our journey, learning from bugs, and celebrating successful deployments.

IV. *Professional Ethics & Leadership*

Coding with Conscience Technological skill without ethics is incomplete. Following the ACM global standard, we groom "Human-Centric Tech Leaders." We focus on:

    Understanding the societal impact of algorithms.

    Developing leadership and communication soft skills.

    Adhering to the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.
